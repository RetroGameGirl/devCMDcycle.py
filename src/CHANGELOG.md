* The "Meta" Update

This version focuses on enhancing configurability, improving user experience with custom dialogs, and introducing a powerful internal editor for the application's own default settings.

**New Features:**

* **Integrated Default Config Editor**: A major new feature accessible via `Settings > Edit Default Config`. This opens a live editor that allows the user to modify the application's internal `DEFAULT_CONFIG` using a familiar INI-style format.

* **Live Python Preview**: The editor shows a real-time preview of the generated Python dictionary code.

* **Automated Script Patching**: An "Update devCMDcycle.py" button that safely patches the running script with the new `DEFAULT_CONFIG`.

* **Automatic Script Backups**: Before patching, a backup of the main `.py` file is automatically created in a `script_backup` directory.

* **Rollback Functionality**: Users can now roll back the main script to a previous version from a backup.

* **Custom Modal Dialogs**: Replaced all standard `messagebox` popups with a new suite of custom, centered, and consistently styled dialogs for confirmations, information, and rollback choices, improving the overall look and feel.

* **Copy Functionality**: Added a "Copy" button to both the Toolchain Editor and the Auto-Typer Profile Editor, allowing users to easily duplicate and modify existing configurations.

* **INI Backup System**: Formalized the backup process for the user's `.ini` file. When resetting to defaults, the current configuration is now moved to a dedicated `ini_backup` directory.

* **Undeletable System Items**: Introduced a system to protect core configuration items (like "-- Select Toolchain --") from being deleted by the user, ensuring application stability.

**Changes & Improvements:**

* **Smarter File Browser**: The "Browse..." dialog for the source file now intelligently opens in the directory of the previously selected file, improving workflow.

* **Expanded "About" Window**: The about window has been converted into a comprehensive user manual, explaining the new advanced features like the config editor, composite commands, and the backup system.

* **Windows Process Handling**: Improved subprocess handling on Windows to be more robust and avoid potential deadlocks with `cmd.exe`.

* The "Toolchain" Update

This was a massive architectural overhaul, transforming the application from a specialized Atari 7800 tool into a generic, flexible, and powerful command-line automation front-end. The core concept of "Toolchains" was introduced.

**New Features:**

* **Toolchain System**: The hardcoded "7800AsmDevKit" and "CC65" logic was completely replaced with a fully configurable Toolchain system.

* **Toolchain Editor**: A new window (`Settings > Edit Toolchains...`) for managing all aspects of a toolchain.

* **Toolchain Options Editor**: A new window for creating toolchain-specific options (e.g., compiler flags).

* **Dynamic Auto-Typer System**: The old "Header Wizard" was replaced by a far more powerful and generic "Auto-Typer Profile" system.

* **Auto-Typer Profile Editor**: A new, dedicated window for managing auto-typer profiles.

* **Composite Commands**: Action buttons can now execute a sequence of other buttons (e.g., `Button3,Button8,Button4`) to chain actions like Build -> Header -> Run.

* **Dark Mode**: Added a "Dark Mode" option in the settings.

**Changes & Improvements:**

* **Complete UI Redesign**: The main window UI was rebuilt from the ground up to be dynamic.

* **Configuration Overhaul**: The `.ini` file format was significantly changed to support the new structures.

* **Settings Window Revamp**: The Settings window was redesigned to be the hub for the new editors.

* **Improved ANSI Color Support**: Enhanced the status window's ability to display colored command-line output.

**Removed:**

* Removed the hardcoded "Header Wizard" in favor of the new Auto-Typer system.

* Removed the static "7800AsmDevKit Options" and "CC65 Options" frames.

$$

* The "Transitional" Update

This version marked the first major step away from a hardcoded application towards a more configurable system. It refined the auto-typer and laid the groundwork for the full toolchain model.

**New Features:**

* **Header Wizard**: Introduced a graphical "Header Command Wizard" in the Settings window, allowing users to build `7800header` commands visually by selecting options from checkboxes.

* **Auto-Typer for Headers**: Added an "Enable Auto-Typer for Header Tool" option. When enabled, the application automatically sends the command string generated by the Header Wizard to the interactive `7800header` tool prompt.

* **Configurable Delays**: Added settings for "Initial Delay" and "Command Delay" to fine-tune the auto-typer's timing.

* **INI to Dictionary Converter**: A separate utility script (`iniCMDcycle_v219.py`) was created to help users convert their `.ini` toolchain configurations into the Python dictionary format required for embedding into the main script's `DEFAULT_CONFIG`.

**Changes & Improvements:**

* **Refined Settings UI**: The settings window was reorganized to accommodate the new Header Wizard and auto-typer options.

* **Early Toolchain Concept**: While not fully implemented, the `DEFAULT_CONFIG` structure in this version shows the conceptual shift towards a dictionary-based toolchain system, separating paths, actions, and options.

1.15
$$

* Initial Release

This was the first version of the application, designed as a personal helper for Atari 7800 homebrew development.

* **Core Functionality**: Provided a graphical front-end to run build and emulation commands.

* **Dual Compiler Support**: Included specific, hardcoded support for the "7800AsmDevKit" and "CC65" compilers.

* **Header Wizard**: Featured an integrated "Header Wizard" to graphically build the command string for the `7800header` utility.

* **Status Window**: Included a status window with an input bar for interacting with command-line tools.

* **INI Configuration**: All settings were stored and loaded from a `devCMDcycle_115.ini` file.
